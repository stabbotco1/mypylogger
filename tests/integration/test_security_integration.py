"""Integration tests for security scanning and zero-tolerance policy enforcement.

This test module validates that the security infrastructure works correctly
and enforces the zero-tolerance security policy as required.

Requirements Addressed:
- 6.3: Configure workflow to fail on any security vulnerabilities
- 6.4: Require zero security issues found before allowing PR merges
- 6.5: Scan both direct and transitive dependencies for vulnerabilities
- 6.6: Provide detailed security reporting when vulnerabilities detected
