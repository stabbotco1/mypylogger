### ✅ Minimal Configuration Validation
**Status**: PASSED  
**Details**: Module works with minimal configuration
- Requires only PyYAML as external dependency
- Works with basic scanner configuration (pip-audit only)
- Default values provide sensible fallbacks
- No complex setup requirements

### ✅ Example Configurations Validation
**Status**: PASSED  
**Details**: All 4 example configurations are valid
- `minimal-setup.yml` - For small/personal projects
- `python-library.yml` - For Python packages and libraries  
- `python-web-app.yml` - For Django/Flask/FastAPI applications
- `enterprise-project.yml` - For large corporate environments
- All configurations have proper YAML syntax and required sections

### ✅ Deployment Simulation Validation
**Status**: PASSED  
**Details**: Security module deploys successfully to new project
- Module can be copied to new project directories
- Works in different project structures (flat, nested, monorepo)
- Scripts are executable and have proper entry points
- No hardcoded paths or project-specific dependencies

### ✅ Consistent Behavior Validation
**Status**: PASSED  
**Details**: Module behaves consistently across different project structures
- Same functionality regardless of project organization
