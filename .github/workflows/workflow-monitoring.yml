# Workflow Monitoring and Alerting for mypylogger v0.2.0
#
# This workflow provides comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all
# CI/CD workflows, tracking performance metrics, failure rates, and
# execution times to ensure optimal pipeline performance.
#
# Requirements Addressed:
# - 5.1: Set up workflow performance monitoring
# - 5.1: Configure failure rate tracking and alerts
# - 5.1: Add execution time monitoring for performance optimization
