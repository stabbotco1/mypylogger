# Security Scanning Workflow for mypylogger v0.2.0
#
# This workflow implements comprehensive security monitoring with zero-tolerance policy
# for vulnerabilities. It performs continuous security scanning and blocks any code
# integration when security issues are detected.
#
# Requirements Addressed:
# - 6.1: Scan dependencies for known security vulnerabilities using GitHub security scanning
# - 6.2: Scan code for security vulnerabilities using GitHub CodeQL analysis
# - 6.3: Fail workflow and prevent code integration when any security vulnerabilities detected
# - 6.4: Require zero security issues found before allowing pull request merges
# - 6.5: Scan both direct and transitive dependencies for vulnerabilities
# - 6.6: Provide detailed security reports when vulnerabilities are detected

name: Security Scanning
