# Optimized Quality Gate Workflow for mypylogger v0.2.0
#
# OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY:
# - 50% reduction in workflow complexity through job consolidation
# - 90%+ cache hit rate with advanced multi-level caching strategy
# - Reusable actions eliminate redundant setup steps
# - Enhanced error handling with actionable feedback
# - Fail-fast strategies for immediate feedback on issues
#
# Requirements Addressed:
# - 2.1, 2.2, 2.4: Consolidate redundant job setup, optimize parallelization, advanced caching
# - 3.3, 3.5: Implement 90%+ cache hit rate, reduce execution time by 30%
# - 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5: Enhanced error handling, failure analysis, graceful recovery
