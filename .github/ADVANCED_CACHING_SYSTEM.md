## Cache Key Optimization Strategies

### Hierarchical Key Patterns

The system uses hierarchical cache keys with multiple fallback levels to maximize cache hit rates:

```yaml
# Dependencies Cache Keys
primary: "v2-{os}-py{python_version}-deps-{lock_hash}-{pyproject_hash}"
fallback_1: "v2-{os}-py{python_version}-deps-{lock_hash}-"
fallback_2: "v2-{os}-py{python_version}-deps-"
fallback_3: "v2-{os}-py{python_version}-"
fallback_4: "v2-{os}-"
```

### Smart Key Generation

- **Lock File Hash**: SHA256 of `uv.lock` for dependency tracking
- **PyProject Hash**: SHA256 of `pyproject.toml` for configuration tracking
- **Workflow Hash**: Combined hash of workflow files for tool configuration
- **Run ID**: GitHub run ID for cross-job sharing
- **Commit SHA**: Git commit hash for workflow-specific artifacts

## Performance Optimization Features

### 1. Parallel Cache Operations

All cache operations are designed to run in parallel where possible:
- Multiple cache levels can be restored simultaneously
- Cross-job cache sharing operates independently
- Cache invalidation runs in parallel across cache types

### 2. Aggressive Cache Warming

The system implements proactive cache warming strategies:
- Pre-population of common dependencies
- Build tool cache preparation
- Cross-job artifact sharing
- Predictive cache loading based on workflow patterns

### 3. Smart Cache Invalidation

Intelligent invalidation prevents unnecessary cache misses:
- Change detection based on file modifications
- Selective invalidation by cache type
- Preservation of unaffected caches
- Impact assessment before invalidation

### 4. Cross-Job Cache Sharing

Enables sharing of cache data across different jobs in the same workflow run:
- Shared dependency installations
- Common build tool configurations
- Workflow-specific artifacts
- Performance metrics and analytics data

## Monitoring and Analytics

## Configuration and Customization

### Workflow-Specific Configuration

Each workflow can be configured with specific caching parameters:

```yaml

```

### Cache Retention Policies

Three retention policies are available:

#### Conservative Policy
- High Priority Caches: 30 days
- Medium Priority Caches: 14 days
- Low Priority Caches: 7 days
- Size-based cleanup: Only when >150% of threshold

#### Balanced Policy (Default)
- High Priority Caches: 14 days
- Medium Priority Caches: 7 days
- Low Priority Caches: 3 days
- Size-based cleanup: When >120% of threshold

#### Aggressive Policy
- High Priority Caches: 7 days
- Medium Priority Caches: 3 days
- Low Priority Caches: 1 day
- Size-based cleanup: When at threshold

### Optimization Levels

Three optimization levels provide different performance/reliability trade-offs:

#### Basic Optimization

#### Large Cache Size (>1GB)
- **Cause**: Inefficient retention policies or cache bloat
- **Solution**: Implement aggressive retention policy, enable compression
- **Action**: Use cache size optimizer with `aggressive` mode

#### Performance Degradation
- **Cause**: Cache invalidation or infrastructure issues
- **Solution**: Monitor cache trends, adjust optimization levels
- **Action**: Review analytics dashboard for insights

The system provides automatic optimization recommendations:

1. **Cache Key Optimization**: Improve hit rates through better key strategies
2. **Size Optimization**: Reduce cache size through retention policies
3. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust optimization levels for better performance
