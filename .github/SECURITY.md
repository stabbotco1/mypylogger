# Zero-Tolerance Security Policy

## Overview

mypylogger maintains a **zero-tolerance security policy** for all security vulnerabilities. This means:

- **No security vulnerabilities** are acceptable in any form
- **All security scans must pass** before code can be merged
- **Immediate action required** when vulnerabilities are detected
- **Zero exceptions** to this policy

## Security Scanning Coverage

Our comprehensive security scanning includes:

### Dependency Security
- **pip-audit**: Scans Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **safety**: Additional dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates for security patches

### Code Security Analysis
- **CodeQL**: Advanced semantic code analysis for security issues
- **Bandit**: Python-specific security linting
- **Static analysis**: Comprehensive code security review

### Secret Detection
- **TruffleHog**: Scans for accidentally committed secrets
- **Pattern matching**: Detects API keys, passwords, tokens

### Supply Chain Security
- **Dependency verification**: Validates package integrity
- **License compliance**: Ensures secure licensing
- **Transitive dependency analysis**: Deep dependency tree scanning

## Vulnerability Response Process

### Immediate Response (0-4 hours)
1. **Automatic blocking**: CI/CD pipeline blocks all merges
2. **Alert generation**: Security team receives immediate notification
3. **Issue creation**: Automated security issue created with details
4. **Escalation**: Critical vulnerabilities escalated to maintainers

### Resolution Timeline
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24 hours maximum
- **High severity**: 48 hours maximum
- **Medium/Low severity**: 72 hours maximum (still blocks merges)

### Emergency Procedures
- **Immediate block**: All development stops until resolution
- **Create security issue**: Detailed tracking and documentation
- **Notify maintainers**: Direct communication to project leads
- **Document incident**: Full post-mortem and lessons learned

## Security Requirements for Contributors

### Before Contributing
- Review this security policy completely
- Understand zero-tolerance requirements
- Set up local security scanning tools

### During Development
- Run security checks locally before pushing
- Never commit secrets or sensitive data
- Use secure coding practices
- Update dependencies regularly

### Pull Request Requirements
- All security scans must pass (no exceptions)
- Security review required for sensitive changes
- Documentation updates for security-related changes

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Internal Issues (Project Contributors)
1. Create a security issue using the security template
2. Label with appropriate severity level
3. Assign to security team for immediate review
4. Follow up within 24 hours if no response

### External Security Reports
1. **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: [security@mypylogger.dev]
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Provide impact assessment if possible
5. Allow 48 hours for initial response

### Responsible Disclosure
- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- Security researchers are credited appropriately
- Coordinated disclosure timeline established
- Public disclosure only after fixes are available

## Security Tools and Configuration

### Required Tools
- pip-audit (dependency scanning)
- bandit (Python security linting)
- CodeQL (semantic analysis)
- TruffleHog (secret detection)

### Configuration Files
- `.github/SECURITY_CONFIG.yml`: Central security configuration
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`: Automated scanning workflow
- `scripts/security_check.sh`: Local security validation script

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **CWE Top 25**: Common weakness enumeration
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Comprehensive security guidelines

### Audit Requirements
- All security scans logged and retained (365+ days)
- Resolution time tracking for all vulnerabilities
- Detection accuracy metrics maintained
- Regular security posture reviews

## Zero-Tolerance Policy Details

### What This Means
- **No security vulnerabilities** of any severity level are acceptable
- **All security scans must pass** without exceptions or waivers
- **Immediate action required** when any vulnerability is detected
- **Development stops** until all security issues are resolved

### Enforcement
- Automated CI/CD blocking on any security scan failure
- Manual override capabilities disabled for security checks
- Regular security audits and policy compliance reviews
- Escalation procedures for policy violations

### Exceptions
**There are no exceptions to this policy.** All security vulnerabilities must be addressed regardless of:
- Severity level (even "low" severity blocks merges)
- Development timeline pressures
- Feature release deadlines
- External dependencies or constraints
