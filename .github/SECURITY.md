# Security Policy

## mypylogger v0.2.0 Security Policy

mypylogger v0.2.0 takes security seriously and implements a **zero-tolerance policy** for security vulnerabilities. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and response protocols.

## Zero-Tolerance Security Policy

### Policy Statement

mypylogger v0.2.0 enforces a **zero-tolerance policy** for security vulnerabilities:

- **No security vulnerabilities** are permitted in any release
- **No known vulnerabilities** are permitted in any release
- **All security scans must pass** before code integration
- **Pull request merging is blocked** when security issues are detected
- **Immediate remediation** is required for all security findings
- **Immediate action required** for all security vulnerabilities

### Scope

This policy applies to:
- All source code in the repository
- All dependencies (direct and transitive)
- All secrets and sensitive data
- All CI/CD pipeline configurations
- All security configurations and policies

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.1.x   | :x:                |

## Security Scanning and Monitoring

### Security Scanning Coverage

mypylogger v0.2.0 implements comprehensive security scanning across all aspects of the codebase and dependencies:

- **100% Dependency Coverage**: All direct and transitive dependencies scanned
- **Complete Source Code Analysis**: Static analysis of all Python source files
- **Full Repository History**: Secret scanning across entire Git history
- **Configuration Validation**: Security policy and configuration verification
- **Zero-Tolerance Enforcement**: No exceptions to security requirements

### Automated Security Scans

Our CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive security scanning:

#### 1. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
- **Tool**: pip-audit, Dependabot
- **Frequency**: Every commit, daily scheduled scans
- **Coverage**: Direct and transitive dependencies
- **Action**: Automatic blocking on vulnerabilities

#### 2. Static Code Security Analysis
- **Tool**: GitHub CodeQL, Bandit
- **Frequency**: Every commit
- **Coverage**: All Python source code
- **Queries**: Security-focused and extended query suites

#### 3. Secret Detection
- **Tool**: TruffleHog, GitHub Secret Scanning
- **Frequency**: Every commit
- **Coverage**: Full repository history
- **Action**: Immediate blocking and alert

#### 4. Security Configuration Validation
- **Frequency**: Every workflow run
- **Coverage**: Security policies and configurations
- **Validation**: Zero-tolerance policy enforcement

### Security Monitoring

- **Real-time monitoring** of security scan results
- **Automated alerting** on security policy violations
- **Performance tracking** of security scan execution
- **Compliance reporting** and audit trails

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in mypylogger, please report it responsibly:

#### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/mypylogger/mypylogger/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if known)

#### Alternative Method: Email

Send an email to: **security@mypylogger.dev**

Include:
- Subject line: "Security Vulnerability Report - mypylogger"
- Detailed vulnerability description
- Proof of concept (if applicable)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### What NOT to Do

- **Do not** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- **Do not** discuss vulnerabilities in public forums
- **Do not** attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in production systems

## Vulnerability Response Process

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 1 hour        | 24 hours        |
| High     | 24 hours      | 7 days          |
| Medium   | 7 days        | 30 days         |
| Low      | 30 days       | Next release    |

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** (within response time)
   - Confirm receipt of vulnerability report
   - Assign severity level and tracking ID
   - Provide initial assessment

2. **Investigation** (within 24-48 hours)
   - Reproduce and validate the vulnerability
   - Assess impact and affected versions
   - Develop remediation plan

3. **Remediation** (within resolution time)
   - Develop and test security fix
   - Create security advisory
   - Prepare coordinated disclosure

4. **Disclosure** (after fix is available)
   - Release security update
   - Publish security advisory
   - Credit vulnerability reporter (if desired)

## Security Requirements for Contributors

### Mandatory Security Practices

All contributors to mypylogger v0.2.0 must follow these security requirements:

#### Code Security Requirements
- **Run security scans locally** before submitting pull requests
- **Pass all security gates** in the master test script (`./scripts/run_tests.sh`)
- **Never commit secrets** or sensitive data to the repository
- **Use secure coding practices** as outlined in our development guidelines
- **Follow zero-tolerance policy** - no security exceptions allowed

#### Dependency Management
- **Keep dependencies updated** to their latest secure versions
- **Validate new dependencies** for security vulnerabilities before adding
- **Use minimal dependencies** - only add dependencies that are absolutely necessary
- **Review transitive dependencies** for security issues

#### Development Workflow
- **Enable branch protection** - all changes must go through pull requests
- **Require security scan approval** - PRs cannot merge with security failures
- **Use signed commits** when possible for authenticity
- **Follow secure development lifecycle** practices

#### Security Testing Requirements
- **Write security-focused tests** for new functionality
- **Test error handling** and edge cases thoroughly
- **Validate input sanitization** and output encoding
- **Test authentication and authorization** logic

### Security Training and Awareness

Contributors are expected to:
- **Stay informed** about current security threats and best practices
- **Participate in security reviews** when requested
- **Report security concerns** immediately through proper channels
- **Follow responsible disclosure** practices for vulnerabilities
