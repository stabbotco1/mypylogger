# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds unused dependency detection to the mypylogger project's quality gates to ensure that all dependencies listed in pyproject.toml are actually used in the codebase. This addresses the current gap where unused dependencies like jinja2 and python-json-logger are not detected by existing quality checks.

## Glossary

- **Dependency Detection Tool**: A tool that analyzes Python projects to identify dependencies listed in pyproject.toml that are not imported or used anywhere in the source code
- **Quality Gate**: A mandatory check that must pass before any task or code change can be considered complete
- **Master Test Script**: The ./scripts/run_tests.sh script that serves as the definitive quality validation for the project
- **Unused Dependency**: A package listed in the dependencies section of pyproject.toml that is not imported or referenced anywhere in the source code or tests

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused dependencies to be automatically detected during quality checks, so that the project maintains a clean dependency list without bloat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the master test script runs, THE Master Test Script SHALL execute dependency detection checks
2. WHEN unused dependencies are found, THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL report specific unused packages
3. WHEN all dependencies are used, THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL pass without errors
4. THE Master Test Script SHALL fail with non-zero exit code if unused dependencies are detected
5. THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL check both runtime dependencies and development dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the dependency detection tool to be properly configured and integrated, so that it works reliably across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL be added to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
2. THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL be configured to scan the src/ and tests/ directories
3. THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL ignore known false positives if any exist
4. THE Master Test Script SHALL include clear error reporting when dependency checks fail
5. THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL use the UV package manager for execution consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dependency detection to integrate seamlessly with existing quality gates, so that it doesn't disrupt the current development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Master Test Script SHALL add dependency checking as a new numbered section
2. THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL follow the same error handling patterns as existing quality checks
3. THE Master Test Script SHALL provide helpful error messages and suggested fixes for dependency issues
4. THE Dependency Detection Tool SHALL complete execution within reasonable time limits (<30 seconds)
5. THE Master Test Script SHALL maintain the same overall success/failure reporting format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up the currently unused dependencies, so that the project achieves its zero-dependency goal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Project Configuration SHALL remove jinja2 from the dependencies list
2. THE Project Configuration SHALL remove python-json-logger from the dependencies list  
3. THE Project Configuration SHALL update the project description to accurately reflect zero dependencies
4. THE Master Test Script SHALL pass all quality gates after unused dependencies are removed
5. THE Package Import Verification SHALL continue to work correctly after dependency cleanup
