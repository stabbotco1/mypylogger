# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Implement a file-based test coverage badge system for mypylogger v0.2.7 that eliminates timeout errors by storing test coverage results locally and updating badges through file-based mechanisms. This approach replaces the previous API-based coverage badge implementation with a reliable, fast, and maintainable solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing test infrastructure.

## Glossary

- **Test_Coverage_Results_File**: The `docs/test-coverage-results.md` file containing structured test coverage data
- **Coverage_Badge_System**: The complete file-based implementation for test coverage badge generation and display
- **Master_Test_Script**: The enhanced `scripts/run_tests.sh` script that generates coverage results file
- **Badge_Link**: GitHub link from README badge to the test coverage results file
- **Coverage_Color_Logic**: Color-coded badge display based on coverage percentage thresholds
- **Structured_Results_Format**: Human-readable format including coverage percentage, test counts, and execution summary
- **README_Badge_Update**: Automatic update of README.md badge during test script execution
- **PyPI_Badge_Display**: Badge visibility on PyPI package page through README integration
- **GitHub_File_Link**: Direct link to `docs/test-coverage-results.md` file on GitHub repository

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test coverage results stored in a local file, so that badge updates are fast and reliable without external API timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Master_Test_Script SHALL generate a Test_Coverage_Results_File at `docs/test-coverage-results.md` after test execution
2. THE Test_Coverage_Results_File SHALL contain structured, human-readable coverage data including percentage, test counts, and execution summary
3. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL read coverage data from the Test_Coverage_Results_File instead of running pytest directly
4. THE Test_Coverage_Results_File SHALL be updated atomically to prevent corruption during concurrent access
5. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL handle missing or corrupted Test_Coverage_Results_File gracefully with fallback values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the test coverage badge to link to detailed results, so that users can access comprehensive coverage information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL generate a badge that links to the GitHub_File_Link for `docs/test-coverage-results.md`
2. THE Badge_Link SHALL provide direct access to detailed test coverage results on GitHub
3. THE GitHub_File_Link SHALL be formatted as `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/main/docs/test-coverage-results.md`
4. THE Badge_Link SHALL work correctly for both repository visitors and PyPI package page viewers
5. THE Test_Coverage_Results_File SHALL be committed to the repository for public access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want color-coded coverage badges, so that I can quickly assess coverage quality at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coverage is 95% or higher, THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL display a green badge
2. WHEN coverage is between 90% and 94%, THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL display an amber/yellow badge
3. WHEN coverage is below 90%, THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL display a red badge
4. THE Coverage_Color_Logic SHALL be consistent across all badge display contexts (README, PyPI)
5. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL handle edge cases (0%, 100%) correctly with appropriate colors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the README badge updated automatically, so that coverage information stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Master_Test_Script SHALL update the README.md coverage badge automatically after generating Test_Coverage_Results_File
2. THE README_Badge_Update SHALL use the file-based coverage data instead of running additional coverage commands
3. THE README_Badge_Update SHALL maintain atomic write operations to prevent file corruption
4. THE Master_Test_Script SHALL complete badge updates within the existing script execution without timeouts
5. THE README_Badge_Update SHALL preserve all other README content and formatting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a PyPI package user, I want to see the coverage badge on the package page, so that I can assess package quality before installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL ensure badges display correctly on PyPI package pages
2. THE PyPI_Badge_Display SHALL use the same badge URL and linking as the repository README
3. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL work with PyPI's markdown rendering for package descriptions
4. THE Badge_Link SHALL remain functional when viewed from PyPI package pages
5. THE PyPI_Badge_Display SHALL reflect the same coverage data as the repository badge

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured test results with comprehensive information, so that I can understand test execution details beyond just coverage percentage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Coverage_Results_File SHALL include coverage percentage as the primary metric
2. THE Structured_Results_Format SHALL include total test count and test execution results
3. THE Test_Coverage_Results_File SHALL include timestamp of test execution
4. THE Structured_Results_Format SHALL include test execution summary (passed, failed, skipped)
5. THE Test_Coverage_Results_File SHALL be human-readable and well-formatted for direct viewing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to clean up existing coverage badge references, so that the new file-based system is the only implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL replace all existing API-based coverage badge implementations
2. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL update all references in existing specs and documentation
3. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL remove or update existing test coverage badge code in the badges module
4. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL ensure no conflicts between old and new coverage badge implementations
5. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing badge display locations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast and reliable badge updates, so that the development workflow is not slowed by badge generation timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL complete all operations within 10 seconds of test completion
2. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL avoid external API calls that could cause timeouts
3. THE Master_Test_Script SHALL generate coverage results and update badges in a single execution
4. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL provide clear error messages if file operations fail
5. THE Coverage_Badge_System SHALL allow test execution to succeed even if badge updates fail
