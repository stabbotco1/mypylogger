# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A temporary phase to fix critical race conditions in the security automation workflows that violate the fundamental requirement to never create race conditions. This phase implements proper Git rebase logic and conflict resolution to ensure clean repository history and prevent timestamp conflicts in automated security updates.

## Glossary

- **Race_Condition**: Situation where multiple workflows attempt to modify and commit the same files simultaneously
- **Rebase_Logic**: Git workflow pattern using `git pull --rebase origin main` to maintain linear commit history
- **Conflict_Resolution**: Automated process to detect and resolve merge conflicts during rebase operations
- **Security_Workflow**: GitHub Actions workflow that updates security findings and reports
- **Timestamp_Conflict**: Merge conflict caused by different automated processes updating timestamp fields
- **Linear_History**: Git commit history without merge commits, maintained through rebase operations
- **Workflow_Coordination**: System to prevent multiple security workflows from running simultaneously

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security workflows to never create race conditions, so that repository history remains clean and merge conflicts are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple security workflows are triggered simultaneously, THE Security_Workflow SHALL coordinate execution to prevent conflicts
2. WHEN a security workflow runs, THE Security_Workflow SHALL use `git pull --rebase origin main` before attempting to push changes
3. WHEN rebase conflicts occur, THE Security_Workflow SHALL detect and resolve timestamp-only conflicts automatically
4. THE Security_Workflow SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages if non-timestamp conflicts are detected
5. THE Security_Workflow SHALL maintain linear commit history without merge commits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated conflict resolution for security file updates, so that timestamp differences don't block automated workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timestamp conflicts occur in `security/findings/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md`, THE Security_Workflow SHALL automatically accept the newer timestamp
2. WHEN timestamp conflicts occur in `security/reports/latest/bandit.json`, THE Security_Workflow SHALL automatically accept the newer timestamp
3. WHEN timestamp conflicts occur in `security/reports/archived/*/bandit.json`, THE Security_Workflow SHALL automatically accept the newer timestamp
4. THE Security_Workflow SHALL preserve all non-timestamp content during conflict resolution
5. THE Security_Workflow SHALL log all automatic conflict resolutions for audit purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want workflow coordination to prevent simultaneous security updates, so that only one security workflow runs at a time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Workflow SHALL implement workflow concurrency controls to limit execution to one instance
2. WHEN a security workflow is already running, THE Security_Workflow SHALL queue subsequent triggers or skip execution
3. THE Security_Workflow SHALL provide clear status messages when workflows are queued or skipped
4. THE Security_Workflow SHALL complete within reasonable time limits to prevent indefinite blocking
5. THE Security_Workflow SHALL handle workflow cancellation gracefully without leaving repository in inconsistent state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust rebase logic that handles edge cases, so that automated workflows are reliable and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rebase operations fail due to conflicts, THE Security_Workflow SHALL provide detailed error information
2. WHEN rebase operations succeed, THE Security_Workflow SHALL verify repository state before pushing
3. THE Security_Workflow SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient Git failures
4. THE Security_Workflow SHALL validate that all expected files are present and correctly formatted after rebase
5. THE Security_Workflow SHALL abort and report errors if repository state becomes inconsistent

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want existing security workflows updated to use proper rebase logic, so that current automation continues working without race conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE existing `security-scan.yml` workflow SHALL be updated to implement proper rebase logic
2. THE existing security automation scripts SHALL be updated to handle rebase conflicts
3. THE existing workflow triggers SHALL be reviewed and consolidated to minimize simultaneous execution
4. THE Security_Workflow SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing security findings format
5. THE Security_Workflow SHALL preserve all existing functionality while eliminating race conditions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the rebase fix implementation, so that future maintenance and troubleshooting is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE rebase fix SHALL include comprehensive documentation of conflict resolution logic
2. THE rebase fix SHALL document workflow coordination mechanisms and their behavior
3. THE rebase fix SHALL provide troubleshooting guides for common rebase failure scenarios
4. THE rebase fix SHALL document testing procedures to verify race condition elimination
5. THE rebase fix SHALL include rollback procedures if issues are discovered after deployment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation that the rebase fix eliminates race conditions, so that I can be confident the solution is effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE rebase fix SHALL include test scenarios that simulate simultaneous workflow execution
2. THE rebase fix SHALL demonstrate successful conflict resolution for timestamp conflicts
3. THE rebase fix SHALL verify that workflow coordination prevents simultaneous execution
4. THE rebase fix SHALL validate that repository history remains linear after fix implementation
5. THE rebase fix SHALL confirm that all existing security automation functionality continues working
