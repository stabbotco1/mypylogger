# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for Phase 1 of mypylogger v0.2.0 development, focusing on establishing a complete project foundation with modern Python tooling, quality gates, and development infrastructure.

## Glossary

- **UV**: Fast Python package installer and resolver used for dependency management
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter built with Rust
- **pytest**: Python testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **mypy**: Static type checker for Python
- **TDD**: Test-Driven Development methodology
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks that must pass before code completion
- **Master Test Script**: Comprehensive test runner that validates all quality criteria

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly structured Python project, so that I can develop mypylogger v0.2.0 with modern best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE project structure SHALL follow Python packaging standards with src/ layout
2. THE project SHALL include proper .gitignore for Python development artifacts
3. THE project SHALL have a comprehensive README.md with installation and usage instructions
4. THE project SHALL use pyproject.toml for all configuration and metadata
5. THE project structure SHALL support both source code and comprehensive testing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UV-based dependency management, so that I can have fast, reliable, and reproducible builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE project SHALL use UV for all dependency management operations
2. THE project SHALL have python-json-logger as the single runtime dependency
3. THE project SHALL include pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, and mypy as development dependencies
4. THE project SHALL generate and maintain uv.lock for reproducible builds
5. THE project SHALL support Python 3.8+ as specified in pyproject.toml

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper source code structure, so that the mypylogger package can be developed and distributed effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE project SHALL have a src/mypylogger/ directory for the main package
2. THE src/mypylogger/ directory SHALL include proper __init__.py files
3. THE package structure SHALL support standard Python import patterns
4. THE source structure SHALL be compatible with modern Python build tools
5. THE package SHALL be installable in development mode via UV

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can ensure code quality and reliability through TDD.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE project SHALL have a tests/ directory with proper organization
2. THE testing infrastructure SHALL support both unit and integration tests
3. THE project SHALL achieve 95% minimum test coverage requirement
4. THE testing setup SHALL integrate with pytest and coverage reporting
5. THE tests SHALL run quickly to support TDD workflow (<5 seconds for unit tests)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly configured development tools, so that I can maintain consistent code quality and style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE project SHALL use Ruff for both linting and formatting with 100-character line length
2. THE project SHALL use mypy for static type checking with strict configuration
3. THE project SHALL have zero tolerance for linting, formatting, or type errors
4. THE development tools SHALL be accessible via `uv run` commands
5. THE project SHALL support automated formatting and linting workflows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a master test script, so that I can validate all quality gates before task completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE project SHALL have a ./scripts/run_tests.sh master test runner script
2. THE master script SHALL run all tests with coverage reporting (95% minimum)
3. THE master script SHALL validate linting, formatting, and type checking
4. THE master script SHALL return non-zero exit codes on any failure
5. THE master script SHALL be the definitive quality gate for all task completion
