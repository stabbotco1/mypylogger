# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A comprehensive security module that provides automated tracking, documentation, and remediation planning for security vulnerabilities. The final system maintains real-time visibility into security posture through structured documentation, automated findings management, and integrated remediation tracking. This module is designed as a self-contained, reusable pattern that can be deployed across projects to establish consistent security governance.

## Glossary

- **Security_Module**: Complete security governance system organized under `security/` directory
- **Findings_Document**: Live markdown document at `security/findings/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md` showing current vulnerabilities
- **Remediation_Registry**: YAML datastore at `security/findings/remediation-plans.yml` with 1:1 finding-to-plan mapping
- **Security_Reports**: Structured storage at `security/reports/` for raw scanner outputs and historical data
- **Finding_ID**: Unique vulnerability identifier (CVE, GHSA, PYSEC) used as primary key across all components
- **Automated_Maintenance**: System behavior where findings and remediation entries are automatically synchronized
- **Modular_Deployment**: Self-contained security module that can be copied between projects

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a live security findings document that always reflects current vulnerability status, so that security posture is immediately visible and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Module SHALL maintain `security/findings/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md` with current vulnerability status
2. THE Security_Module SHALL display findings ordered by severity with Finding_ID and source scanner
3. THE Security_Module SHALL include temporal information showing discovery date and days since detection
4. THE Security_Module SHALL automatically reflect changes when security scans detect new or resolved vulnerabilities
5. THE Security_Module SHALL provide clear formatting with sections for active findings and remediation status
5. THE Security_Module SHALL provide common detail information for findings that inform the user with additional detail specific to the findings - ie descrirption, url to more detail that is minimal but helpful to someone looking for an immediate summary and is often common to secuirity findings
### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want structured remediation planning that stays synchronized with current findings, so that every vulnerability has a documented response plan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Module SHALL maintain `security/findings/remediation-plans.yml` with structured remediation data
2. THE Security_Module SHALL ensure 1:1 mapping between Finding_IDs in scan results and remediation entries
3. THE Security_Module SHALL create default remediation entries automatically for newly discovered findings
4. THE Security_Module SHALL remove remediation entries automatically when findings are resolved
5. THE Security_Module SHALL allow manual editing of remediation plans without affecting automated synchronization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want clear visibility into security findings and planned remediation, so that I can understand current risk and mitigation timeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL present findings in a clear, ordered format with severity levels
2. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL include separate sections for current findings and planned remediation
3. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL show temporal information including discovery dates and aging
4. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL provide risk context and impact assessment for each finding
5. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL maintain consistent formatting and structure across updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on multiple projects, I want to reuse this security findings system across projects, so that I can implement consistent security tracking with minimal effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Module SHALL organize all security artifacts within a dedicated security directory structure
2. THE Security_Module SHALL maintain separate subdirectories for findings, reports, scripts, and configuration files
3. THE Security_Module SHALL be implemented as a modular, reusable pattern
4. THE Security_Module SHALL require minimal configuration for deployment to new projects
5. THE Security_Module SHALL work with standard security scanning tools (pip-audit, bandit, etc.)
6. THE Security_Module SHALL include clear documentation for copy-paste deployment
7. THE Security_Module SHALL maintain consistent behavior across different project structures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want historical tracking and audit trails for security findings, so that I can demonstrate due diligence and response times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL maintain historical records of when findings were discovered
2. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL track remediation timeline and completion status
3. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL provide audit trail of document updates and changes
4. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL include metrics on response times and resolution rates
5. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL support compliance reporting requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer migrating to the new security system, I want existing security data and infrastructure to be seamlessly integrated, so that historical data is preserved and current workflows continue functioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Module SHALL migrate existing security reports from legacy directory structures to the new security directory
2. THE Security_Module SHALL preserve historical security scan data during migration
3. THE Security_Module SHALL update existing scripts and workflows to use the new security directory paths
4. THE Security_Module SHALL maintain backward compatibility during the migration process
5. THE Security_Module SHALL validate that migrated data is accessible and functional in the new structure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline, I want to integrate security findings updates seamlessly with existing workflows, so that security documentation stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL integrate with existing GitHub Actions security workflows
2. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL process security scan artifacts automatically
3. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL update findings document as part of CI/CD execution
4. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL handle multiple security scanner outputs in a single run
5. THE Security_Findings_System SHALL maintain workflow performance without significant overhead
