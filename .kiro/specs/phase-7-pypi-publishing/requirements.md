# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Phase 7 establishes PyPI publishing infrastructure with security-driven automation for mypylogger v0.2.0. This phase implements automated PyPI publishing workflows that are triggered by security findings changes, while maintaining manual control for code releases. The system provides live security status reporting without requiring unnecessary releases.

## Glossary

- **PyPI_Publishing_System**: The automated workflow system that publishes mypylogger packages to the Python Package Index
- **Security_Driven_Release**: An automated release triggered by changes in security findings or vulnerability status
- **Live_Security_Status**: A dynamic reporting system that shows current security posture without requiring package releases
- **OIDC_Authentication**: OpenID Connect authentication system for secure PyPI publishing via AWS identity federation
- **Release_Automation_Engine**: The GitHub Actions workflow system that determines when releases should be triggered
- **Security_Findings_Monitor**: The weekly scanning system that detects changes in vulnerability status

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want automated PyPI publishing triggered by security changes, so that users always have access to packages with current security documentation without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security findings change significantly, THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL automatically trigger a new package release
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are discovered in dependencies, THE Security_Driven_Release SHALL include updated security documentation
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are fixed, THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL publish a release with updated security status
4. WHERE manual code changes occur, THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL support manual release triggers
5. THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL NOT create releases when security status remains unchanged

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want live security status reporting, so that I can see current vulnerability information without waiting for new package releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Live_Security_Status SHALL provide current vulnerability information independent of package releases
2. WHEN security scans complete weekly, THE Live_Security_Status SHALL update automatically
3. THE Live_Security_Status SHALL display days since vulnerability discovery for transparency
4. WHERE README badges reference security status, THE Live_Security_Status SHALL provide current data
5. THE Live_Security_Status SHALL be accessible via GitHub Pages or API endpoint

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want secure PyPI authentication via AWS OIDC, so that publishing credentials are managed securely without storing secrets in GitHub.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE OIDC_Authentication SHALL use AWS identity federation for PyPI publishing
2. THE OIDC_Authentication SHALL NOT require stored secrets in GitHub repository
3. WHEN publishing to PyPI, THE OIDC_Authentication SHALL provide temporary credentials
4. THE OIDC_Authentication SHALL integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflows
5. IF OIDC_Authentication fails, THEN THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want minimal unnecessary releases, so that the package version history remains meaningful and users are not overwhelmed with frequent updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Release_Automation_Engine SHALL NOT create weekly releases unless security posture changes
2. WHEN security findings remain unchanged, THE Release_Automation_Engine SHALL skip release creation
3. THE Release_Automation_Engine SHALL distinguish between security-driven and code-driven releases
4. WHERE no new vulnerabilities are discovered, THE Release_Automation_Engine SHALL maintain current release
5. THE Release_Automation_Engine SHALL provide release justification in release notes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a package user, I want immediate visibility into security status, so that I can make informed decisions about package usage without waiting for releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Security_Findings_Monitor SHALL scan dependencies weekly for new vulnerabilities
2. WHEN new vulnerabilities are detected, THE Security_Findings_Monitor SHALL update live status immediately
3. THE Security_Findings_Monitor SHALL track vulnerability discovery timestamps
4. WHERE vulnerability fixes are available, THE Security_Findings_Monitor SHALL indicate remediation status
5. THE Security_Findings_Monitor SHALL integrate with existing security infrastructure from Phase 6

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline, I want reliable release workflows, so that PyPI publishing succeeds consistently and provides appropriate feedback on failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL validate package integrity before publishing
2. WHEN publishing fails, THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL provide detailed error information
3. THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL support both manual and automated trigger mechanisms
4. WHERE network issues occur, THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. THE PyPI_Publishing_System SHALL integrate with existing quality gates from previous phases

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want transparent security reporting, so that I can assess the project's security posture and response times to vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Live_Security_Status SHALL provide vulnerability discovery dates for transparency
2. THE Live_Security_Status SHALL show time elapsed since vulnerability discovery
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are remediated, THE Live_Security_Status SHALL record resolution timestamps
4. THE Live_Security_Status SHALL maintain historical security findings data
5. WHERE security documentation exists, THE Live_Security_Status SHALL provide direct links to detailed findings
