# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Complete removal of all badge-related functionality, files, directories, references, and dependencies from the mypylogger project. This is a comprehensive "scorched earth" approach to eliminate all badge implementation logic and related artifacts while maintaining project functionality and ensuring all quality gates continue to pass.

## Glossary

- **Badge System**: Any functionality related to generating, displaying, or managing project badges (performance, coverage, build status, etc.)
- **Badge Files**: Any files specifically created for badge generation or storage
- **Badge References**: Any mentions, imports, or configurations related to badge functionality in code or documentation
- **Quality Gates**: The master test script (`./scripts/run_tests.sh`) and GitHub CI/CD workflows
- **Project Integrity**: Ensuring the project continues to function normally after badge removal

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all badge-related files and directories completely removed from the project, so that the codebase is clean and free of broken badge implementation logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove the entire `badge-data/` directory
3. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related scripts from the `scripts/` directory
4. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related files from any location in the project
5. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related directories from the project structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all badge-related code references removed from all source files, so that there are no broken imports or function calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related imports from Python files
2. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related function calls from Python files
3. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related class definitions and methods
4. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related configuration variables
5. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related constants and data structures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all badge references removed from documentation and configuration files, so that the project documentation is accurate, clean, and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge references from README.md
2. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge references from documentation files in the `docs/` directory
3. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related dependencies from pyproject.toml
4. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related configuration from any config files
5. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge URLs, links, and markdown badge syntax
6. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL update documentation to maintain consistency after badge removal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all badge-related CI/CD workflow steps removed, so that the GitHub Actions workflows run successfully without badge-related failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge generation steps from GitHub Actions workflows
2. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge upload steps from CI/CD pipelines
3. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related environment variables from workflows
4. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL remove all badge-related job dependencies from workflows
5. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL ensure all remaining workflow steps continue to function correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the project to maintain full functionality after badge removal, so that all quality gates continue to pass and the project remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL ensure the master test script (`./scripts/run_tests.sh`) passes completely
2. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL ensure all GitHub CI/CD workflows pass without issues
3. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL ensure all remaining Python imports resolve correctly
4. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL ensure no broken references or dead code remains
5. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL ensure project functionality is unaffected by badge removal

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive verification that no badge-related artifacts remain, so that I can be confident the removal is complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL verify no files contain "badge" in their filename
2. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL verify no directories contain "badge" in their name
3. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL verify no code contains badge-related function names or imports
4. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL verify no documentation contains badge-related markdown or links
5. THE Badge_Removal_System SHALL verify no configuration files contain badge-related settings
