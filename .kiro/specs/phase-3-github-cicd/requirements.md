# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Phase 3 of mypylogger v0.2.0 focuses on implementing automated quality and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions. This phase establishes comprehensive CI/CD workflows that enforce quality gates, automate testing, and provide a foundation for reliable software delivery. The system will ensure that all code changes meet quality standards before integration and provide automated mechanisms for package distribution.
