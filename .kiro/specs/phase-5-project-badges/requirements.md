# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Implement a fast and lean badge system for mypylogger v0.2.0 that displays professional project badges in README.md and works correctly when published to PyPI. This MVP implementation focuses on the specific set of badges shown in the project requirements, using shields.io integration with minimal code footprint and robust file handling to prevent race conditions during concurrent updates.

## Glossary

- **Badge_System**: The complete implementation including generation scripts, README integration, and security checks
- **Shields_Integration**: Use of shields.io service for dynamic badge generation and display
- **Badges_Directory**: The ./badges directory containing all badge-specific implementation code
- **Atomic_Write**: File update mechanism using temporary files and rename operations to prevent corruption
- **Security_Checks**: Local execution of bandit, safety, semgrep, and CodeQL-equivalent scanning
- **Comprehensive_Security_Badge**: A unified security badge that combines local security scanning with GitHub CodeQL results
- **GitHub_CodeQL_Integration**: Integration with GitHub's CodeQL security scanning workflow and results
- **Security_Badge_Link**: Clickable link from security badge to detailed GitHub CodeQL scan results
- **PyPI_Compatibility**: Ensuring badges work correctly after package publication to PyPI
- **Race_Condition_Prevention**: Retry mechanism with 5-second waits up to 10 attempts for file contention
- **README_File**: The main project documentation file where badges will be inserted
- **CICD_Integration**: Ensuring badge system works correctly within GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- **README_Badge_Display**: Actual insertion and display of badges in the project README.md file
- **PyPI_Downloads_Integration**: Direct shields.io integration with PyPI download statistics for real-time download counts

8. THE Badge_System SHALL implement license badge showing "MIT"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all badge code contained in a dedicated directory, so that the project root remains clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL place all badge-specific code in the ./badges directory
2. THE Badge_System SHALL minimize files placed in the project root directory
3. THE Badge_System SHALL only modify existing root files (README.md and scripts/run_tests.sh)
4. THE Badge_System SHALL organize badge generation scripts within the Badges_Directory
5. THE Badge_System SHALL contain all badge utilities and helpers within the Badges_Directory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want badges to use shields.io integration with Python APIs, so that they update automatically and work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL use Shields_Integration for all badge generation
2. THE Badge_System SHALL implement badge status detection using Python API calls
3. THE Badge_System SHALL avoid external dependencies beyond Python standard library and existing project dependencies
4. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure badges work correctly when published to PyPI
5. THE Badge_System SHALL implement fast and lean badge generation with minimal code footprint

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want atomic README updates with race condition prevention, so that concurrent badge updates do not corrupt the file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL implement Atomic_Write operations for README.md updates
2. WHEN file contention is detected, THE Badge_System SHALL wait 5 seconds and retry
3. THE Badge_System SHALL attempt up to 10 retries before failing
4. THE Badge_System SHALL use temporary files and rename operations to prevent corruption
5. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure README.md integrity during concurrent access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want security and CodeQL checks integrated into local testing, so that I can catch issues before GitHub Actions execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL integrate Security_Checks into scripts/run_tests.sh
2. THE Badge_System SHALL run bandit security scanner locally
3. THE Badge_System SHALL run safety dependency scanner locally  
4. THE Badge_System SHALL run semgrep security analysis locally
5. THE Badge_System SHALL simulate CodeQL analysis locally where possible
6. THE Badge_System SHALL integrate local security scan results with GitHub CodeQL results for Comprehensive_Security_Badge status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want badge status to reflect current CI/CD state, so that the information is accurate and represents the actual deployed code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL update badges only through CI/CD workflows after successful test execution
2. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure badges reflect the actual state of code in the main branch
3. THE Badge_System SHALL prevent local badge updates that could create inconsistencies with CI state
4. THE Badge_System SHALL commit updated README badges back to the main branch after CI success
5. THE Badge_System SHALL use CI environment as the single source of truth for badge status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want an MVP badge implementation with minimal optimization, so that I can quickly deploy working badges with end-to-end functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL implement only the minimum code needed for end-to-end badge functionality
2. THE Badge_System SHALL avoid optimization beyond what is necessary for basic operation
3. THE Badge_System SHALL focus on MVP delivery rather than performance optimization

5. THE Badge_System SHALL provide complete end-to-end badge workflow with minimal complexity

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want badges to be updated exclusively by CI/CD workflows, so that badge status always reflects the actual tested and deployed code state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL update README badges only after successful CI/CD test execution
2. THE Badge_System SHALL commit updated README back to main branch with appropriate commit messages
3. THE Badge_System SHALL use "[skip ci]" in badge update commits to prevent infinite CI loops

5. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure local development focuses only on code and tests, not badge updates

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want a single comprehensive security badge that shows all security-related test results, so that I can assess the complete security posture of the project at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL implement a single comprehensive security badge that combines all security scanning results (local and GitHub CodeQL)
2. THE Badge_System SHALL integrate local security scans (bandit, safety, semgrep) with GitHub CodeQL scanning results
