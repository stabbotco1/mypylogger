# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Implement a fast and lean badge system for mypylogger v0.2.0 that displays professional project badges in README.md and works correctly when published to PyPI. This MVP implementation focuses on the specific set of badges shown in the project requirements, using shields.io integration with minimal code footprint and robust file handling to prevent race conditions during concurrent updates.

## Glossary

- **Badge_System**: The complete implementation including generation scripts, README integration, and security checks
- **Shields_Integration**: Use of shields.io service for dynamic badge generation and display
- **Badges_Directory**: The ./badges directory containing all badge-specific implementation code
- **Atomic_Write**: File update mechanism using temporary files and rename operations to prevent corruption
- **Security_Checks**: Local execution of bandit, safety, semgrep, and CodeQL-equivalent scanning
- **PyPI_Compatibility**: Ensuring badges work correctly after package publication to PyPI
- **Race_Condition_Prevention**: Retry mechanism with 5-second waits up to 10 attempts for file contention
- **README_File**: The main project documentation file where badges will be inserted
- **CICD_Integration**: Ensuring badge system works correctly within GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- **README_Badge_Display**: Actual insertion and display of badges in the project README.md file

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the exact badges shown in the project specification, so that I can quickly assess project status and compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL implement quality-gate.yml status badge using GitHub Actions workflow status
2. THE Badge_System SHALL implement security-scan.yml status badge using GitHub Actions workflow status  
3. THE Badge_System SHALL implement code style badge showing "ruff" formatting compliance
4. THE Badge_System SHALL implement type checking badge showing "mypy" validation status
5. THE Badge_System SHALL implement Python version compatibility badge showing "3.8 | 3.9 | 3.10 | 3.11 | 3.12"
6. THE Badge_System SHALL implement PyPI version badge showing "v0.2.0" 
7. THE Badge_System SHALL implement downloads badge showing "development" status
8. THE Badge_System SHALL implement license badge showing "MIT"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all badge code contained in a dedicated directory, so that the project root remains clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL place all badge-specific code in the ./badges directory
2. THE Badge_System SHALL minimize files placed in the project root directory
3. THE Badge_System SHALL only modify existing root files (README.md and scripts/run_tests.sh)
4. THE Badge_System SHALL organize badge generation scripts within the Badges_Directory
5. THE Badge_System SHALL contain all badge utilities and helpers within the Badges_Directory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want badges to use shields.io integration with Python APIs, so that they update automatically and work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL use Shields_Integration for all badge generation
2. THE Badge_System SHALL implement badge status detection using Python API calls
3. THE Badge_System SHALL avoid external dependencies beyond Python standard library and existing project dependencies
4. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure badges work correctly when published to PyPI
5. THE Badge_System SHALL implement fast and lean badge generation with minimal code footprint

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want atomic README updates with race condition prevention, so that concurrent badge updates do not corrupt the file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL implement Atomic_Write operations for README.md updates
2. WHEN file contention is detected, THE Badge_System SHALL wait 5 seconds and retry
3. THE Badge_System SHALL attempt up to 10 retries before failing
4. THE Badge_System SHALL use temporary files and rename operations to prevent corruption
5. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure README.md integrity during concurrent access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want security and CodeQL checks integrated into local testing, so that I can catch issues before GitHub Actions execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL integrate Security_Checks into scripts/run_tests.sh
2. THE Badge_System SHALL run bandit security scanner locally
3. THE Badge_System SHALL run safety dependency scanner locally  
4. THE Badge_System SHALL run semgrep security analysis locally
5. THE Badge_System SHALL simulate CodeQL analysis locally where possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want badge status to reflect current project state, so that the information is accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining badge status, THE Badge_System SHALL run actual tests and checks
2. WHEN test results exist, THE Badge_System SHALL read results from existing test outputs  
3. THE Badge_System SHALL determine badge status based on badge type requirements
4. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure badge status accurately reflects current main branch state
5. THE Badge_System SHALL update badge status when project state changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want an MVP badge implementation with minimal optimization, so that I can quickly deploy working badges with end-to-end functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL implement only the minimum code needed for end-to-end badge functionality
2. THE Badge_System SHALL avoid optimization beyond what is necessary for basic operation
3. THE Badge_System SHALL focus on MVP delivery rather than performance optimization
4. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure badges work correctly in both development and PyPI publication contexts
5. THE Badge_System SHALL provide complete end-to-end badge workflow with minimal complexity

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want badges to work correctly with CI/CD workflows, so that automated builds and deployments do not fail due to badge system errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL execute without errors in GitHub Actions CI/CD environments
2. THE Badge_System SHALL handle network timeouts and API failures gracefully in CI/CD contexts
3. THE Badge_System SHALL not cause CI/CD pipeline failures when badge generation encounters errors
4. THE Badge_System SHALL provide appropriate exit codes for CI/CD integration
5. THE Badge_System SHALL work correctly with automated testing and deployment workflows

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer visiting the project repository, I want to see professional badges displayed in the README, so that I can quickly assess project quality and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Badge_System SHALL update the project README.md file with actual badge display
2. THE Badge_System SHALL insert badges in a prominent location within the README_File
3. THE Badge_System SHALL ensure badges are properly formatted and clickable in the README_File
4. THE Badge_System SHALL maintain README_File formatting and structure when inserting badges
5. THE Badge_System SHALL provide a complete visual representation of project status through README_Badge_Display
